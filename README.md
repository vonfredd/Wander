# MVC village builder game

This is a village builder game. Based on the resources you produce, you can construct more buildings and increase the rate at which resources are produced.
MVC pattern.

I was inspired by an online game and decided to create my own version to see if I could do it myself.

> [!NOTE]  
>As I learned more from my Java education, I decided to create a new version of the game to make the code cleaner based on my newfound knowledge. 
The project is called [Village-Builder](https://github.com/vonfredd/Village-Builder).
